      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Founded in 1985, White Water Rafting began as a small, family-owned company in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains. Initially offering guided river rafting tours along the region's scenic and often treacherous rivers, the company quickly gained a reputation for safety, adventure, and exceptional customer service. With a passion for the outdoors and a deep commitment to conservation, White Water Rafting became a leader in eco-friendly adventure tourism.
        <br />Throughout the years, the company expanded its offerings, adding kayaking, canoeing, and multi-day expeditions, attracting adventurers from around the world. By the 2000s, White Water Rafting had established locations across the United States and internationally, becoming a recognized name in the adventure travel industry.
        <br />Today, White Water Rafting is known for its innovative trips, expert guides, and commitment to environmental sustainability. They continue to inspire thrill-seekers and nature lovers to explore the wild beauty of rivers worldwide.
